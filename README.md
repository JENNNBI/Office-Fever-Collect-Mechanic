# Office-Fever-Collect-Mechanic

This game is one of my friend's game. Its a huge success for him and his company. And i like how just papers collecting and deal for the tables. So i tried to my way&knowlegde.

The result was not as bad as i expected. I was moving the player with raycast and for the smooth transition i used DOTween(the best unity asset). And I'm still learning the DOTween usage.



This is the basic environment models for an office that I'm happy with.

The only thing i want to say about this project is that you can do this mechanic with a advanced	technique which calls "Object Pool".
Instead of Object Pool i builts this project with a easy IEnumerator which i don't recommend because  it is not as stabile and optimize as Object Pool.
