# Office-Fever-Collect-Mechanic

This game was developed by a friend and it became a huge success for him and the company.  

I like the way how just papers collecting and dealing for the tables. Thus, I have tried to replicate it in my way&knowlegde.

The result was not as bad as I expected. I was moving the player with RayCast and for the smooth transition, I have used DOTween(the best unity asset). And I'm still learning the DOTween usage.

These were the basic environment models for an office and I'm happy with them.

The only thing I want to say about this project is that you can do this mechanic with an advanced technique which is called "Object Pool". Instead of Object Pool, I have built it with an easy IEnumerator which I don't recommend since it is not as stable and optimized as Object Pool.
